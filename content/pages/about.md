Summary: About me

I'm a researcher who trained in computaional biology, but who has experience in NLP, and in ML research more broadly. Most recently, I've worked on multimodal [models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VdX9tL3VXH) for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. 


I've also done applied ML research in:

 - [dynamics of functional diversity](http://bayesiandeeplearning.org/2021/papers/63.pdf)
 - [counterfactual explanation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Rodriguez_Beyond_Trivial_Counterfactual_Explanations_With_Diverse_Valuable_Explanations_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf) 
 - [active learning](https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/20210240680?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiIyNTI0ZTczMy1mNTQ3LTQ2MjktODIyOS1lODY3Yzk0ODM4OTIiLCJ2ZXIiOiI2OTBhZDhlOS05NzJkLTRhNTMtYTA4Mi0yZDhmNjgzNmRkZGMiLCJleHAiOjB9) 
 - NLP (semantic parsing, uncertainty modeling)

Before starting my industrial research career, I was a post-doctoral fellow in Christina Leslie's [lab](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/christina-leslie) at MSKCC, where I worked on models of DNA sequence (using ATAC-seq), chromatin structure (using Hi-C), and sequence embedding. My PhD work involved modeling distributions of phenotypes from high content imaging studies.
