Summary: About me

I'm a post-doctoral researcher that's interested in developing new machine learning methods for problems in computational biology.
My primary training is in computing, statistics, machine learning.  My prior work involved working with cell image studies, but my current work deals with modeling chromatin structure from sequencing data (HiC).

During my PhD, I maintained a blog called [Images of Yeast](https://cerevisuals.wordpress.com/)
