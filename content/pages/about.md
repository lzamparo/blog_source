Summary: About me

I'm a computaional biologist and researcher who uses machine learning.  Most recently, I was a senior scientist at [Recursion](https://www.recursionpharma.com).  Before then, I was an applied research scientist at ElementAI, and subsequently at [ServiceNow Research](https://www.servicenow.com/research/) after its acquisition.

Before starting my industrial research career, I was a post-doctoral fellow in Christina Leslie's [lab](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/christina-leslie) at MSKCC, where I worked on models of DNA sequence (using ATAC-seq), chromatin structure (using Hi-C), and sequence embedding. My PhD work involved modeling distributions of phenotypes from high content imaging studies.
