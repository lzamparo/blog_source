    "Recently I've been reading papers from NLP, triaging those ideas which offer the best balanced return (novelty, applicability for my data) for time investment, and testing them out on ATAC-seq data.  For those which don't offer a ready-made implementation available, I'm left with having to roll my own.  This is a much more involved process than `git clone`, and after this last experience I'll tell you about now, I'm not sure it's worth the bother. \n",

    "There are too many ways in which a re-implementation can deviate from the published method, especially if the source of the errors can be confounded between data set and model.  In this latest attempt, wherein I attempted to re-implement dynamic k-max pooling.  The idea is a good one; instead of keeping just the maximum value of activations in a sequence $p$, instead keep the in-order $k$ maximum values $p_{max}^k$.  This is invariant to the distances between the values, and could be used to detect multiple common subsequence patterns in a longer sequence (think motifs within accessible chromatin). The original paper by [Kalchbrenner, Grefenstette & Blunsom](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2188) describes the method quite clearly, and a follow-up paper by [Denil et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3830) further simplifies the model.  Both demonstrate its ability to summarize natural language sentences by evaluating its performance on a task of classifying the sentiment of tweets.  The data set, which stems from a [2009 paper](http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students), scraped and curated 1.6m tweets for multi-class sentiment analysis.  Fair enough, I thought, I can get the data, process it just as they have, code up dynamic k-max pooling, and then see if my results approach their own.  \n",

    "Two weeks later, I do not have a good model for classifying the sentiment of tweets.  But worse yet, I don't know if my model is wrong (which I care about), or my pre-processing of the Twitter sentiment data set is preventing my model from succeeding (which I don't care about). \n",

    "I am far from the first person to [try](https://towardsdatascience.com/yet-another-twitter-sentiment-analysis-part-1-tackling-class-imbalance-4d7a7f717d44) and analyze this data set.  Multiple papers or blog posts describe how they prepare this data set, but few of them agree on how it should be done.  Only one describes what they do  in sufficient detail to be reproducible.  Below is a table describing how four different attempts set about pre-processing the data to arrive at a vocabulary: "
